"Access Control" and "Data Protection" are among the most relevant and problematic topics of our day. Policies are considered an important resource for companies and individuals to keep abreast of updated information and best practices on these topics. 

This assignment includes two different publicly explicit policies. During the task, I have reviewed "Access Control" and "Data Protection and Data Security" policies, noticed strengths and their accordance with global security standarts (e.g. ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002, NIST CSF). After the review, I thought about how to enhance these policies and strengthen companies security posture based on policies. I have shared my enhancement ideas for each policy in the document.
